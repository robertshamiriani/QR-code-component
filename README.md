## Overview

### The challenge

-  challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
- The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`
- **To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**
- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
- Want some support on the challenge? [Join our BitCamp community](https://facebook.com/groups/bitcamp.ge/permalink/8389844074389186/) and ask questions.
